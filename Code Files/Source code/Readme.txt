Project Topic : Hate Speech Detection Using Machine Learning And Deep Learning With Stream Lit Frame Work

1. Data Collection
	Here for this project we are using CSV file format of dataset to predict the hate speech 

2. Data Pre processing
	It is a process of reducing the Null values, noisy data, etc....

3. NLTK Model 

4. Splitting of datasets 
	Train and test 

5. Model Implementation 
	Machine Leraning Algorithm 
		Random forest 
	Deep Learning 
		LSTM
		RNN 

6. Prediction 
	Accuracy 

7. Importing the Pre trained models into the stream lit frame work

To run the stream lit project 

1. Open Anaconda prompt 

2. Change the directory of the folder - press enter 

3. Copy the file path 

4. now type in prompt as "cd paste the path here"  - press enter 

5. now type " streamlit run web_app.py"

6. Opens in web 

7. Enter any text 

8. Prediction 
	Positive 
	Negative 
	Neutral
